# six-letter-wordle
Wordle, but with six letters instead of five, per my brother's request.

## Local development
Clone the repository, then install the dependencies using

```
npm i
```

You can then start up the dev server by running

```
npm run start
```

This will make the game available at `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to build a production copy, run `npm run build`.

To lint the codebase, run `npm run lint`. If you want to fix chnages as well, run `npm run lint:fix`.
